This folder is made to have an approppiate structure of the project, dividing the different steps into each their respective notebook. This has several benefits, including smaller notebooks and no need to rerun an entire project during wrongful (while learning) calculations.

1. Preprocessing
    - Understanding the data

2. Generate Data
    - Generating test data

3. Supervised learning
    - Training a supervised model on the test data

4. Meshgrid analysis
    - Comparing the models and their results.

Prototype: Unsupervised learning
    - Training an unsupervised model on the test data.
